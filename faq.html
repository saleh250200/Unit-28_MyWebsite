<summary>What Is Fake News?</summary>
<p class="text">There are two kinds of fake news:</p>
<p> 1. Stories that aren't true. These are entirely invented stories designed to make people believe something false, to buy a certain product, or to visit a certain website.</p>

<p> 2. Stories that have some truth, but aren't 100 percent accurate. </p>

<summary>How to Spot Real and Fake News?</summary>
<p class="text">Six Ways to Spot Fake News:</p>
<p> 1. Develop a Critical Mindset</p>
<p> 2. Check the Source</p>
<p> 3. See Who Else Is Reporting the Story</p>
<p> 4. Examine the Evidence</p>
<p> 5. Don't Take Images at Face Value</p>
<p> 6. Check That it "Sounds Right"</p>

<details>
<summary>Where Does Fake News Come From?</summary>
<p class="text">It's become harder to identify the original source of fake news stories.</p>
<p>But there are some sources such as social media:</p>
<p>Social media platforms allow almost anyone to publish their thoughts or share stories to the world. The trouble is, most people don't check the source of the material that they view online before they share it, which can lead to fake news spreading quickly or even "going viral."</p>

<details>
<summary>Why is it a problem?</summary>
<p class="text">Fake news is a problem for different reasons.</p>
<p>The first kind of fake news - deliberate lies - is a problem because it can make people believe things that are completely untrue.</p>
<p>The second kind - when people publish something without checking that it's completely right - can make people have less trust in the media, as well as make everyone believe something that might be inaccurate.</p>
<p>People also only tend to share things that they agree with. So if people are sharing a lot of fake news, and lots of people believe it, it's easy to get sucked into a bubble that is actually completely different to the real world - and a long way from the truth.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are we talking about it?</summary>
<p class="text">Fake news has become a big issue recently - especially following the US election.</p>
<p>For that reason people should have to know more about fake news so they can read the right news and listen to the right news to do the right things.</p>
